# Ansible Overview

## üìå What is Ansible?

Ansible is an open-source **automation tool** used for **configuration management**, **application deployment**, **orchestration**, and **task automation**. It allows you to automate IT infrastructure tasks such as provisioning servers, managing configurations, and deploying code with simple, human-readable YAML files called **Playbooks**.

It is **agentless**, meaning it doesn‚Äôt require any software or agent to be installed on the target nodes. It uses **SSH** to connect to remote machines by default.

## ‚úÖ Why Use Ansible?

- **Simplicity and Ease of Use**  
  Ansible uses YAML syntax, which is straightforward and human-readable, even for those without deep programming knowledge.

- **Agentless Architecture**  
  No need to install agents on the managed nodes ‚Äî reduces overhead and simplifies maintenance.

- **Idempotent Execution**  
  Ensures that running a playbook multiple times results in the same system state ‚Äî no repeated changes.

- **Scalability**  
  Manage hundreds or thousands of servers from a single control machine.

- **Extensible and Powerful**  
  Supports roles, modules, templates, and plugins for organizing and extending functionality.

- **Community and Enterprise Support**  
  Backed by Red Hat with a strong community and Ansible Galaxy for reusable content.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How Ansible Works

### Key Concepts:

- **Inventory**  
  A file (usually `hosts` or `inventory.ini`) that lists the target machines grouped by roles or environment.

- **Modules**  
  Reusable units of work (e.g., `apt`, `yum`, `copy`, `service`, `file`) that perform tasks on the remote hosts.

- **Playbooks**  
  YAML files that define a series of tasks to be executed on remote machines in a particular order.

- **Tasks**  
  Individual units of work defined in a playbook, using Ansible modules.

- **Roles**  
  A way to group related tasks, variables, templates, and files into reusable components.

- **Variables and Templates**  
  Dynamic content and configuration management using variables and Jinja2 templating.

### Execution Flow:

1. **Control Node** (your local machine or Ansible server) has:
   - Ansible installed
   - Inventory file
   - Playbooks

2. You run an Ansible command or playbook:
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook site.yml -i inventory.ini
